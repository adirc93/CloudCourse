#question 10
#   Run your code as shown above, for example run iperf flow between two hosts,
#   between witch of the pair it works, witch are blocked? You can add more tests of you own

#Answer:
#   Works:
#   iperf h1 h2
#   iperf h1 h3
#   iperf h1 h4
#   iperf h2 h1
#   iperf h2 h3
#   iperf h2 h4

#   Does not work:
#   iperf h3 h1
#   iperf h3 h2
#   iperf h4 h1
#   iperf h4 h2

#Of course this is happens due to the firewall
